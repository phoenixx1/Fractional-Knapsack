# Fractional-Knapsack
In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.

The greedy method suggests that one can devise an algorithm which works in stages, considering one input at a time. At each stage, a decision is made regarding whether or not a particular input is in an optimal solution.

# Analysis:
If the provided items are already sorted into a decreasing order of piwi, then the whileloop takes a time in O(n); Therefore, the total time including the sort is in O(n logn).
